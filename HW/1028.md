1. 
	- ACID: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durable
	- BASE: Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency
2. 
	- Database Principles
		- RDBMS: Fully supported
		- NoSQL: Partially supported
	- Data Scale
		- RDBMS: Large
		- NoSQL: Very large
	- Database Schema
		- RDBMS: Fixed
		- NoSQL: Flexible
	- Query Efficiency
		- RDBMS: Fast
		- NoSQL: Can achieve efficient simple queries, but lacks features like highly structured queries, and performance for complex queries is unsatisfactory
	- Consistency
		- RDBMS: Strong consistency
		- NoSQL: Eventual consistency
	- Data Integrity
		- RDBMS: Easy to achieve
		- NoSQL: Difficult to achieve
	- Scalability
		- RDBMS: Moderate
		- NoSQL: Good
	- Availability
		- RDBMS: Good
		- NoSQL: Very good
	- Normalization
		- RDBMS: Y
		- NoSQL: N
	- Technical Support
		- RDBMS: High
		- NoSQL: Low
	- Maintainability
		- RDBMS: Complex
		- NoSQL: Complex
3. Eventual consistency is a consistency model used in distributed computing. It guarantees that if no new updates are made to a given data item, eventually all accesses to that item will return the last updated value.
