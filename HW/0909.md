1. Hadoop具有哪些特性？
2. 试述Hadoop生态系统以及每个部分的具体功能
3. 试列举单机模式和伪分布模式的异同点

1. High reliability, high efficiency, high scalability, high fault tolerance, low cost, Linux compatibility, multi-language support
2. 
	- HDFS: distributed file system
	- MapReduce: distributed parallel programming model
	- YARN: resource management and dispatcher
	- Tez: next generation Hadoop query processing framework based on YARN
	- Hive: data warehouse on Hadoop
	- HBase: distributed NoSQL on Hadoop
	- Pig: data analysis platform on Hadoop, similar to SQL query language Pig Latin
	- Sqoop: transferring data between Hadoop and traditional databases
	- Oozie: workflow management system on Hadoop
	- Zookeeper: distributed system coordinating service provider
	- Storm: stream computing framework
	- Flume: high availability, high reliability, distributed massive log collecting, aggregating, and moving system
	- Ambari: quick Hadoop deploying tool, support Apache Hadoop cluster provisioning, managing and monitoring
	- Kafka: high throughput subscription message posting system, can process all action stream data in customer scale's website
	- Spark: general parallel framework similar to Hadoop MapReduce
3. They both run on a single machine. But pseudo-distributed mode use separate Java process to simulate multi-machine, the node is both NameNode and DataNode, reads file from HDFS. And single-node mode runs a single Java process, doesn't use HDFS, reads file directly from local file system
