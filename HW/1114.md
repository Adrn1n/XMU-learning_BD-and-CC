1. 与传统的软件使用方式相比，云计算这种模式具有哪些明显的优势？
2. 试述UMP系统的组件及其具体作用。

---

1. 
	- Cost-effectiveness: Reduced upfront hardware and software costs, pay-as-you-go models.
	- Scalability: Easily adjust resources (up or down) based on demand.
	- Accessibility: Access applications and data from anywhere with an internet connection.
	- Reliability: Often provides higher uptime and data redundancy.
	- Maintenance: Cloud providers handle infrastructure maintenance and updates.
2. 
	- Mnesia: A distributed database management system used by Controller servers to store system metadata, supporting transactions, data sharding, and fault tolerance.
	- RabbitMQ: An industrial-grade message queue used as a message transport middleware for reliable inter-node communication within the UMP cluster.
	- ZooKeeper: A coordination system providing distributed locks, acting as a global configuration server, and monitoring all MySQL instances. It also helps elect a "manager" among Controller servers.
	- LVS (Linux Virtual Server): Used for load balancing within the UMP cluster, acting as a scheduler to distribute requests to different servers and ensure high availability.
	- Controller Server: Provides various management services for the UMP cluster, including member management, metadata storage, MySQL instance management, fault recovery, backup, migration, and scaling. It runs Mnesia and uses ZooKeeper for high availability.
	- Web Console: Offers a graphical user interface for system management to users.
	- Proxy Server: Provides access to MySQL databases, implementing the MySQL protocol. It handles user authentication, resource quotas, routes SQL queries to backend MySQL instances, and supports features like fault shielding, read/write splitting, sharding, and resource isolation.
	- Agent Server: Deployed on machines running MySQL processes, it manages MySQL instances (e.g., failover, creation, deletion, backup, migration) and collects statistics, slow query logs, and bin-logs.
	- Log Analysis Server: Stores and analyzes user access logs from Proxy servers, supporting real-time queries for slow logs and statistical reports.
	- Information Statistics Server: Periodically collects and visualizes statistics like user connection counts, QPS, and MySQL instance status using RRDtool, aiding in elastic resource allocation and automated MySQL instance migration.
	- yugong: A tool for full and incremental data replication (via bin-log analysis), enabling dynamic scaling and migration of MySQL instances without downtime.
