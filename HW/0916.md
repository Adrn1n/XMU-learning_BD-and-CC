1. 试述HDFS中的块和普通文件系统中的块的区别
2. 试述HDFS中的名称节点和数据节点的具体功能。
3. 试述HDFS的冗余数据保存策略

---

1. HDFS's block size is much bigger than that in the normal file system
2. 
	- NameNode: holds metadata; stores mapping relations among files, blocks and datanode
	- DataNode: holds file content; maintains the mapping between block ids and local files on the datanode
3. 
	- First copy: placed on the datanode where the file is uploaded. If the upload is outside the cluster, a node is randomly chosen, whose disk is not so full and CPU is not so busy.
	- Second copy: placed on a node in a different rack from the first copy.
	- Third copy: a different node which is in the same rack as the first copy.
	- Other copies: random nodes.
